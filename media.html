                            <p>In “Yellowface,” R.F. Kuang satirizes the publishing industry with a tale of a

                                When Athena dies in a freak accident, June steals her unpublished manuscript and
                                publishes
                                it as her own under the ambiguousnname Juniper Song. But as evidence threatens June's
                                stolen success,
                                she will discover exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.</p>

                            <p>Yellowface by R. F. Kuang is a New York Times bestselling novel originally published on
                                May 16, 2023.</p>

                            <p>
                                Throughout What a Time to Be Alone, Eggerue punctuates her message with vibrant snippets
                                of her Nigerian heritage. She shares translations of Igbo proverbs, weaving a canvas of
                                cultural wisdom that amplifies and grounds her messages. These proverbs, passed down
                                from generations,
                                serve as her guiding light, teaching us to value our cultural heritage and use it as a
                                lens by
                                which to understand our world and place within it.
                                As the book reaches a close, we are shown an inspiring image of personal growth and
                                liberation. According to Eggerue, the power of spending time with ourselves lies in the
                                unique
                                perspective it gives us. </p>

                            <p>The Good Immigrant is an anthology of twenty-one essays edited
                                by Nikesh Shukla and first published by Unbound in the UK in 2016 after a crowd-funding
                                campaign endorsed by celebrities. Written by British authors who identify as BAME
                                (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic), the essays concern race, immigration, identity,
                                'otherness', exploring the experience of
                                immigrant
                                and ethnic minority life in the United Kingdom from their perspective.
                                The compilation inspired the American sequel The Good Immigrant USA, published in
                                2017, which featured BAME authors from the United States.

                            <p>Lamya Hs powerful memoir Hijab Butch Blues is an honest grappling with what it means to
                                be queer, to be a devout hijabi Muslim person who resists gender normativity, to love
                                faith
                                and community. Seeking other queer women in Islam as a young person, H wonders if
                                Maryam, whom no man has touched, is like her. She asks if Allah is a man or a woman and,
                                dissatisfied with counsel from religious teachers, decides for herself: Allah is They.
                                Using the second person point-of-view, she asks Muhammad questions about belonging and
                                betrayal.

                            <h3>Rodney Chrome</h3>
                            <p>From intricate choreography to immaculate visuals, Rodney Chrome
                                embodies what it means to be an artist in the most literal context.
                                As a triple threat visionary who would rather create his own lane than bore
                                you with how its been done, there arent many up-and-coming artists
                                with this level of hunger, and it shows.</p>

                            <p>Rodney Chromes self-assuredness is palpable, built brick by brick as a black and queer
                                artist too loud for his conservative town in Arkansas. His NYU commencement speech
                                brought the entire world (and most notably, Taylor Swift) to tears not just because
                                it explored the grit of his story, but because it was raw and honest— like everything
                                else he births into the world. </p>

                            <h3>JPEGMAFIA</h3>
                            <p>JPEGMAFIA (real name Barrington DeVaughn Hendryx) has been a
                                big-name character in alt hip-hop circles for a while, primarily because he really
                                makes himself an iconoclast through his music. There is little in terms of threads
                                back to classic forms of rap in his music, very few in the way of boom-bap or trap
                                beats, and songs seem to deliberately be made like chocolate teapots,
                                dissolving from a semblance of structure into a fascinating mess.</p>

                            <p>JEGMAFIAs material is often abrasive and confrontational.
                                Given his experiences of racism in Alabama growing up, being a veteran of the Iraq war,
                                this fury never feels undeserved.</p>

                            <p>Rustin is based on the true story of Rustin, who helped Martin Luther King Jr. and others
                                organize the 1963 March on Washington. The film tells the story of the charismatic,
                                gay civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. Despite incredible odds, he managed to organize
                                the March on Washington in 1963. This event is considered one of the high points of the
                                civil rights movement in the United States. Over 200,000 people gathered in front of the
                                Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. and called for an end to racial discrimination in
                                the USA. Martin Luther King gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech at the event.</p>

                            <p>Dating Amber (originally titled Beards) is a 2020 Irish coming-of-age comedy-drama film
                                written and directed by David Freyne. The film features two closeted teenagers in 1990s
                                Ireland who decide to start a fake relationship. The film was produced with assistance
                                from Fis Éireann - Screen Ireland, RTÉ, Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BeTV Belgium
                                and
                                BNP Paribas Fortis Film Fund (France). The film was distributed in Ireland through
                                Wildcard.</p>

                            <p>The film is set in 1995 in The Curragh, Ireland, where teenagers Eddie and Amber are
                                treated like outsiders and are distraught over persistent homophobic abuse.
                                They decide to join forces and hide their sexuality from the rural Irish town in which
                                they
                                live by pretending to be a heterosexual couple.</p>

                            <p>Seventeen-year-old Megan Bloomfield is a happy high school senior who loves cheerleading
                                and is dating Jared, a football player. However, she does not enjoy kissing Jared,
                                instead preferring to look at her fellow cheerleaders. This, combined with her interests
                                in
                                vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, leads her parents and friends to
                                suspect that she is a lesbian. They surprise her with an
                                intervention.</p>

                            <p> She is then sent to True Directions, a two-month-long conversion therapy camp intended
                                to convert attendees to heterosexuality via a five-step program in which they admit
                                their homosexuality, rediscover their gender identity by performing stereotypically
                                gender-associated tasks, find the root of their homosexuality, demystify the opposite
                                sex, and simulate heterosexual intercourse.</p>

                            <h3>Dear White People</h3>
                            <p>Set against the backdrop of a predominantly white Ivy League
                                university where racial tensions bubble just below the surface, Dear White People
                                is a hilarious send-up of "post-racial" America that weaves together the universal
                                story of finding one's own identity and forging a wholly unique path. </p>

                            <p> The satirical series -- which picks up where the acclaimed 2014 film
                                by the same name left off - follows a group of Winchester University's students of color
                                as
                                they navigate a diverse landscape of social injustice, cultural bias, political
                                correctness (or lack thereof) and sometimes misguided activism in the millennial age.
                                Through an absurdist lens, Dear White People utilizes biting irony, self-deprecation
                                and sometimes brutal honesty to hold up a mirror to the issues plaguing society today,
                                all the while leading with laughter.</p>

                            <p>Atypical is a coming of age story that follows Sam (played by Keir
                                Gilchrist), a 19-year-old on the autism spectrum as he searches for love and
                                independence.
                                While Sam is on his funny and emotional journey of self-discovery, the rest of his

                                theme of the series: what does it really mean to be normal? In season three, Sam starts
                                his first year of college and is faced with the challenge of figuring out what success
                                means for him, while adjusting to the changes that come with growing up. Jennifer Jason

                                children grow older and more independent, Michael Rapaport plays his father, Doug,
                                and Brigette Lundy-Paine plays Sam's sister, Casey.

                            <h3>Atlanta</h3>
                            <p>The series follows Earn (Donald Glover) during his daily life in Atlanta, Georgia, as he
                                tries to redeem himself in the eyes of his ex-girlfriend Van (Zazie Beetz), who is also
                                the mother of his daughter Lottie, as well as his parents and his cousin Alfred (Brian
                                Tyree Henry), who raps under the stage name "Paper Boi". Having dropped out of Princeton
                                University, Earn has no money and no home and consequently alternates between staying
                                with his parents and his ex-girlfriend. Once he realizes that his cousin is on the verge
                                of stardom, he seeks to reconnect with him in order to improve his life and the life of
                                his
                                daughter.</p>
