                            <h3>Chidera Eggerue- What a time to be alone</h3>
                            <p>What a Time to Be Alone is a self-help book by Chidera Eggerue that emphasizes the importance
                                of embracing solitude and self-love. It provides practical advice and empowering insights
                                for finding happiness and fulfillment within ourselves.
                                Throughout What a Time to Be Alone, Eggerue punctuates her message with vibrant snippets
                                of her Nigerian heritage. She shares translations of Igbo proverbs, weaving a canvas of
                                cultural wisdom that amplifies and grounds her messages. These proverbs, passed down from generations,
                                serve as her guiding light, teaching us to value our cultural heritage and use it as a lens by
                                which to understand our world and place within it.
                                As the book reaches a close, we are shown an inspiring image of personal growth and
                                liberation. According to Eggerue, the power of spending time with ourselves lies in the unique
                                perspective it gives us. </p>

                            <p>The Good Immigrant is an anthology of twenty-one essays edited
                                by Nikesh Shukla and first published by Unbound in the UK in 2016 after a crowd-funding campaign endorsed by
                                celebrities. Written by British authors who identify as BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic), the
                                essays concern race, immigration, identity, 'otherness', exploring the experience of immigrant
                                and ethnic minority life in the United Kingdom from their perspective. Contributors include
                                actor/musician Riz Ahmed, journalist Reni Eddo-Lodge, comedian Nish Kumar and playwright Vinay
                                Patel. The compilation inspired the American sequel The Good Immigrant USA, published in
                                2017, which featured BAME authors from the United States.

                            <h3>Hijaab Butch Blues - Lamya H</h3>
                            <p>Lamya Hs powerful memoir Hijab Butch Blues is an honest grappling with what it means to be
                                queer, to be a devout hijabi Muslim person who resists gender normativity, to love faith
                                and community. Seeking other queer women in Islam as a young person, H wonders if Maryam,
                                whom no man has touched, is like her. She asks if Allah is a man or a woman and, dissatisfied
                                with counsel from religious teachers, decides for herself: Allah is They. She confronts her
                                fear of jinn, who in lore and anecdote are shapeshifters never to be trusted, yet who are too
                                often conflated with brown men from her own community. Reading the story of Yusuf and the
                                kings stolen golden measuring cup forces H to confront her own withholding, how she unfairly
                                tests others because she is afraid to lose them. Using the second person point-of-view, she
                                asks Muhammad questions about belonging and betrayal.

                            <p>British trans artist, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Geo
                                Jordan has released a new EP titled Fathom, featuring the song “I Try to Forget”.
                                This track, part of the 5-song Fathom EP, was entirely written, performed, produced, and
                                mixed by Geo and was released on April 19, 2023. With the singers gentle voice
                                accompanied by beautiful instrumentation that harmonizes perfectly with the vocal performance, 
                                the song is a delight to listen to.

                                The album is a melancholic, futurist piece that delves into themes of losing a loved one
                                and strained relationships. The songs central portion features rich backing vocal pads, a
                                straightforward lead vocal, a dark reversed piano loop, a smooth driving bass line, and
                                simple but snappy hip-hop drums. With a history of prior writing and production credits with 
                                artists like BRIT Award-winning Lianne La Havas, MOBO Award-winning Ego Ella May, Oscar Jerome, 
                                Sasha Keable, Laura Roy, and more, Geo has also extensively toured internationally as a musician 
                                and musical director with critically acclaimed acts such as Jungle, JGrrey, Jack Garratt, and Rina Sawayama.

                            <h3>Victoria Monet</h3>
                            <p>Singer-songwriter, and bisexual icon, Victoria Monét has won best
                                new artist at the 2024 Grammy Awards, beating out fellow nominees Gracie Abrams, 
                                Fred Again, Noah Kahan, Ice Spice, Jelly Roll, Coco Jones, and the War and Treaty for the honour.

                                R&B doesnt get the love it once did, save for a select few musicians. Even so, that
                                doesnt stop some truly talented musicians from releasing music that knocks it out of the park.
                                Victoria Monét clearly has a great deal of love and respect for R&B. It shows
                                consistently from start to finish on her 2023 debut album, JAGUAR II. While JAGUAR II is her debut
                                album, it follows the singer/songwriters 2020 EP, JAGUAR. All an all, Monét brings the
                                heat on this project. There are no glaring miscues to be found.</p>

                            <h3>Rodney Chrome</h3>
                            <p>From intricate choreography to immaculate visuals, Rodney Chrome
                                embodies what it means to be an artist in the most literal context. 
                                As a triple threat visionary who would rather create his own lane than bore 
                                you with how its been done, there arent many up-and-coming artists
                                with this level of hunger, and it shows.</p>

                            <p>Rodney Chromes self-assuredness is palpable, built brick by brick as a black and queer
                                artist too loud for his conservative town in Arkansas. His NYU commencement speech
                                brought the entire world (and most notably, Taylor Swift) to tears not just because 
                                it explored the grit of his story, but because it was raw and honest— like everything 
                                else he births into the world. </p>

                            <h3>JPEGMAFIA</h3>
                            <p>JPEGMAFIA (real name Barrington DeVaughn Hendryx) has been a
                                big-name character in alt hip-hop circles for a while, primarily because he really 
                                makes himself an iconoclast through his music. There is little in terms of threads 
                                back to classic forms of rap in his music, very few in the way of boom-bap or trap 
                                beats, and songs seem to deliberately be made like chocolate teapots, 
                                dissolving from a semblance of structure into a fascinating mess.</p>

                            <p>Even top songs of his like "1539 N. Calvert" lack typical verses or choruses, twisting
                                from clicking glitch-hop into a dusty lo-fi mumble all in the space of under 3 minutes.
                                Comparison points can be made with artists like Earl Sweatshirt, Danny Brown or even
                                $uicideBoy$, but these intersections are like the marginal boundaries of a Venn diagram,
                                asJPEGs pursual of multi-phased and brain-melting instrumentals is like no other rapper or
                                producer out there. JEGMAFIAs material is often abrasive and confrontational. 
                                Given his experiences of racism in Alabama growing up, being a veteran of the Iraq war, 
                                this fury never feels undeserved.</p>

                                of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party - putting him directly in the crosshairs 
                                of the government, the FBI, and the Chicago Police. But to destroy the revolution,

                            <p>Rustin is a 2023 American biographical drama film directed by
                                George C. Wolfe, from a screenplay by Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black, 
                                and a story by Breece about the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin.
                                Produced by Barack and Michelle Obama's production company Higher Ground, 
                                the film stars Colman Domingo in the title role, alongside Chris Rock, Glynn Turman, 
                                Aml Ameen, Gus Halper, CCH Pounder, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Johnny Ramey,

                            <p>It is based on the true story of Rustin, who helped Martin Luther King Jr. and others 
                                organize the 1963 March on Washington. The film tells the story of the charismatic, 
                                gay civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. Despite incredible odds, he managed to organize 
                                the March on Washington in 1963. This event is considered one of the high points of the 
                                civil rights movement in the United States. Over 200,000 people gathered in front of the 
                                Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. and called for an end to racial discrimination in the USA. 
                                Martin Luther King gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech at the event.</p>

                            <p>Dating Amber (originally titled Beards) is a 2020 Irish coming-of-age comedy-drama film
                                written and directed by David Freyne. The film features two closeted teenagers in 1990s
                                Ireland who decide to start a fake relationship. The film was produced with assistance
                                from Fis Éireann - Screen Ireland, RTÉ, Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BeTV Belgium and
                                BNP Paribas Fortis Film Fund (France). The film was distributed in Ireland through Wildcard.</p>

                            <p>The film is set in 1995 in The Curragh, Ireland, where teenagers Eddie and Amber are
                                treated like outsiders and are distraught over persistent homophobic abuse. 
                                They decide to join forces and hide their sexuality from the rural Irish town in which they 
                                live by pretending to be a heterosexual couple.</p>

                            <p>Seventeen-year-old Megan Bloomfield is a happy high school senior who loves cheerleading 
                                and is dating Jared, a football player. However, she does not enjoy kissing Jared, instead
                                preferring to look at her fellow cheerleaders. This, combined with her interests in
                                vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, leads her parents, Peter and Nancy, and friends to
                                suspect that she is a lesbian. Aided by ex-gay Mike, they surprise her with an
                                intervention.</p>

                            <p> She is then sent to True Directions, a two-month-long conversion therapy camp intended
                                to convert attendees to heterosexuality via a five-step program in which they admit their
                                homosexuality, rediscover their gender identity by performing stereotypically
                                gender-associated tasks, find the root of their homosexuality, demystify the opposite
                                sex, and simulate heterosexual intercourse. Upon arrival, she meets strict disciplinarian
                                Mary J. Brown, the program's director. Mary's son Rock is seen throughout the film making
                                multiple sexual overtures towards Mike and the other male campers.</p>

                            <p>Set against the backdrop of a predominantly white Ivy League
                                university where racial tensions bubble just below the surface, Dear White People 
                                is a hilarious send-up of "post-racial" America that weaves together the universal 
                                story of finding one's own identity and forging a wholly unique path. </p>

                            <p> The satirical series -- which picks up where the acclaimed 2014 film
                                by the same name left off - follows a group of Winchester University's students of color as
                                they navigate a diverse landscape of social injustice, cultural bias, political
                                correctness (or lack thereof) and sometimes misguided activism in the millennial age. 
                                Through an absurdist lens, Dear White People utilizes biting irony, self-deprecation 
                                and sometimes brutal honesty to hold up a mirror to the issues plaguing society today, 
                                all the while leading with laughter.</p>

                            <p>Atypical is a coming of age story that follows Sam (played by Keir
                                Gilchrist), a 19-year-old on the autism spectrum as he searches for love and independence.
                                While Sam is on his funny and emotional journey of self-discovery, the rest of his family 
                                must grapple with change in their own lives as they all struggle with the ongoing central
                                theme of the series: what does it really mean to be normal? In season three, Sam starts
                                his first year of college and is faced with the challenge of figuring out what success
                                means for him, while adjusting to the changes that come with growing up. Jennifer Jason

                            <h3>Its a Sin</h3>
                            <p>Russell T Davies's new drama, It's a Sin (Channel 4), is something
                                of a companion piece, 20 years on, to his groundbreaking masterpiece Queer as Folk.
                                The latter was the riotous celebration of gay urban life as led by three friends
                                broadly representing different stages of exploration as they embraced life as hot single men.
                                In essence it was a gorgeous fantasy, designed to counteract both the historic worthiness
                                and prejudice surrounding such depictions.</p>

                            <p>What it did not do was look much at the darkness out of which such freedom had emerged
                                and which still shadowed the lives of its Canal Street party people. It didn't, in short,
                                deal with the effects of Aids on the gay community.
                                It's a Sin does. Without losing any of Davies's gusto, irreverence, joy or subtlety, it
                                follows the lives of three young gay men, Ritchie (Olly Alexander), Roscoe (Omari
                                Douglas) and Colin (Callum Scott Howells) who move to London. They evolve into - in Armistead
                                Maupin's lovely phrase - each other's logical family (along with Ritchie's university
                                best friend Jill, played by Lydia West) as they commit themselves to the enjoyment of every
                                freedom the city has to offer.

                            <p>The series follows Earn (Donald Glover) during his daily life in Atlanta, Georgia, as he
                                tries to redeem himself in the eyes of his ex-girlfriend Van (Zazie Beetz), who is also
                                the mother of his daughter Lottie, as well as his parents and his cousin Alfred (Brian Tyree
                                Henry), who raps under the stage name "Paper Boi". Having dropped out of Princeton
                                University, Earn has no money and no home and consequently alternates between staying
                                with his parents and his ex-girlfriend. Once he realizes that his cousin is on the verge of
                                stardom, he seeks to reconnect with him in order to improve his life and the life of his
                                daughter.</p>

                                <p>Although there is an overarching story depicting Earn and Paper Boi's struggles as the
                                latter ascends through the hip hop scene, the series has been noted for its lack of
                                emphasis on multi-episode story arcs, instead using a somewhat surrealistic style of episodic
                                storytelling that Glover has likened to short stories, as have some critics.</p>
