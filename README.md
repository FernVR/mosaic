# Mosaic Media

## Overview

I created this site to act as a community and blog for reviewing and recommending art and media that celebrates inclusivity and diversity through LGBT+ and BIPOC writers and creators in popular culture. I had the idea for this project when I first decided to pursue coding as I am a writer and musician as well as a proud member of both LGBT+ and BIPOC communities. 

There is access to media resources and community through different areas of the site. The main goals and objectives of Mosaic Media are to provide audiences with inclusive and accessible media that focuses on a diverse perspective, and create a safe communal space for anyone who needs it. The target audience are people with a love for creativity and art, as well as any person, looking for enjoyable and interesting books, music and cinema.

All the material and media provided was selected by myself and my friends, because we connected to it in ways that guided our perspectives and provided support to our own issues and experiences. I wanted to use the idea for this project, as it is a concept close to my heart and I feel it reflects a kind of work I want to do within this industry in the future. I would love to be able to do what I can to create positive and inclusive change to the world around me, through the technologies that we use.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

*   I wanted the colours to display a warm and neutral colour theme, with some brighter colours to add flare and artistic design to the site.

    ![Colour-pallete](./assets/images/readme/colour.png)
    ![Colour-pallete](./assets/images/readme/colour-2.png)

## Typography

*   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font. Montserrat is a clean font and is both attractive and appropriate.

*   I varied between font weights and letter spacing for titles and written content, to make everything clear and easy to read for the user.

## Imagery

*   I worked hard to make sure the imagery was consistent with the layout and theme for the site. I wanted the colours and images to have an artistic and minimal design theme as to not distract from the content.

    ![imagery](./assets/images/home/creator-img-3.webp)

*   The hero image was selected to provide an inviting introduction to the site using a spiral black and white mosaic photo to reflect the name of the site. 


    ![imagery](./assets/images/home/home-banner-small.webp)

*   Photos with text on them have darker overlay to ensure legibility to the text.

## Effects 

*   Hover styles added to all links and buttons so they change colour or display an underline when they're being highlighted to indicate they are clickable for a user.

    ![imagery](./assets/images/readme/hover-effects.png)

## Design Choices 

*   The design is intentionally minimalistic, elegant and warm, to convery a soft, safe and cosy atmosphere for the site as providing a safe space for users is one of the main goals of the site. 

*   The layout and design of the website is consistent across all screen sizes.

## Wireframes

I didnt use any wireframe programmes. I started the project with a clear idea of what I wanted it to look like, then as I moved through the project I realised there were sections that were a bit too complex and took too much time to build. I then compressed the site a great deal to save on time, overall I think next time I will be using wireframes as it was quite time consuming to change each section. 
    
I did some sketches throughout the project of different parts which I've left here for your reference:

-   Text is smaller on smaller screen sizes so the links all fit on the navigation bar nicely. 

-   On larger screen sizes, the navigation links display a growing underline when being higlighted as well as changing the color of the text to show a user the links are clickable.

-   Link of the page you're on will have a different colour text to show that a user is on that page.

    ![Navigation-mobile](./assets/images/readme/header-nav-mobile.jpg)

### Hero Image 

-   The hero image is a spiralled black and white tiled mosaic design, to match the name and theme of the site. 

-   A black transparent overlay is used to enhance the contrast and make the text more legible.

## Media Page 

### Media Banner 

-   Inviting image with text overlay, with a darker opacity to ensure the text is readable. 

-   Heading used for quote on the banner, followed by a brief description of the page content and a navigation element separated by a border line. 

-   Navigation section has bolder font-weight to ensure the text is clear. Hover styles added to the links in the text to show a user can click on them.

    ![media-banner](./assets/images/readme/media-banner-ipad.jpg)
    ![media-banner](./assets/images/readme/media-banner-mobile.jpg)

### Media Section 

-   Headings of each section separate the content from the heading using a border line across the page. This is to show structure on the page between the headings and the content.

-   Media boxes are a stand-out colour with clear contrast for good accessibility. 

-   Media boxes are styled with a border-radius of 2rem. 

-   Links in each section to take you to another page to either purchase a book, stream an artist or watch a film/tv-series. 

    ![media-section](./assets/images/readme/media-section-ipad.jpg)
    ![media-section](./assets/images/readme/media-box-mobile.jpg)

## Community Page 

### Community Banner 

-   Similar styles to media banner in terms of the layout and the colour contrast, this is to maintain a consistent feel of the design across different pages. 

-   Image of a silhouette of a group of friends on top of a peak, this is to add to the overall theme of friendship and community on the page.

    ![community-banner](./assets/images/readme/community-banner-ipad.jpg)

### Community Picks 

-   Similar styles to the media box, but without a description of the material. Instead it just displays the cover, title, author's name and the name and city of the person who submitted it.

-   Community picks boxes display next to each other on a larger screen so the section fits appropriately on a wider screen.

    ![community-picks](./assets/images/readme/community-picks-mobile.jpg)
    ![community-picks](./assets/images/readme/community-picks-ipad.jpg)

### Book Club Section 

-   A brief description of the club and what happens, accompanied by a image of the loction of the meeting spot on google maps, as well as an unordered list with all the details of the club and how to get involved. 

-   Mobile screens will have the information of the book club display one after the other, but on larger screens will display next to each other so the section fits well on a wide screen.

    ![book-club](./assets/images/readme/book-club-ipad.jpg)
    ![book-club](./assets/images/readme/book-club-mobile.jpg)


### Events Section 

-   Image of event, followed by information box containing a description, date, time and ticket information as well as a link to purchase the ticket.

-   Styled with bright and warm colours to match the images. 

-   Titles and important information are written with bolder font-weight to highlight that it's important information. 

    ![event-section](./assets/images/readme/event-box-ipad.jpg)
    ![event-section](./assets/images/readme/event-box-mobile.jpg)
    

### Form Section 

-   Colour of form box is bright and inviting for a user. The box floats on a pretty image of a desk with a coffee cup and books on it. This image was selected because the colours in the photo match the colour pallete of the site.

-   White * star symbols are next to inputs that are required to submit the form. 

-   The buttons have hover styles so the buttons change colour when being higlighted. 

    ![form-section](./assets/images/readme/form-ipad.jpg)

### ThankYou Page

-   A user is redirected to thankyou.html page that shows text thanking the user for their submition as well as a link to 'Go back' to the homepage landing banner. 

-   Home page banner image of mosaic is used as the background image for the thank you page, this is to keep to the theme of the site and branding. 

    ![thank-you-section](./assets/images/readme/thank-you-ipad.jpg)
    ![thank-you-section](./assets/images/readme/thank-you-mobile.jpg)

## Future Features

I planned to include versions of these features in the original structure, but decided to exclude them for this project and focus more on the media and art sections to keep to manage my time and also not over complicate or clutter the webpage.

-   A blog page, where a group of writers contribute their work such as think pieces, historical or scientific essays or local/inernational news stories. 

-   Reviews, the current media page will have an option to click to a full review of the material, as well as the brief description. This is so users have the option to only read some of the description and avoid any spoilers. The reviews would be targetted at users who have already engaged in this material and a spoiler warning will show. 

-   An Activist section that community groups can use to advertise and organise demonstrations, protests or fundraisers. This section would also contain any political/government news and movements, changes in legistlation and upcoming electoral information.

## Further Testing

### Test Grid 

I created a testing grid on Apple Numbers which I used throughout the process of building this site. The grids have categories for each link/button to ensure all of them work correctly and redirect to a new tab if needed. There is also a grid to test responsive design for each section of the page, the different sections are outlined below. I included a screenshot of a blank grid to show the template I used during the project, as I have fixed anything broken from my previous grid. 

![test-grid-template](./assets/images/readme/test-grid-1.jpg)
![test-grid-template](./assets/images/readme/test-grid-2.jpg)


-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

-   The website was viewed and tested on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 10, iPhone 12, iPhone 14 Pro and iPad Pro.

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly, as well as buttons and form submition and inputs.

-   I also did a good amount of testing the responsiveness of the website on different phone screens vertical and horizontal view, to make sure all the images and text are the correct size and position.

-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

-   Tested on all devices available on chrome developer tools.

## Fixed Bugs 

Throughout the process of building this site, I came across many different errors, bugs or warnings that I have since fixed. Mostly syntax/spelling errors, as well as a few issues trying to navigate flexbox. The W3C validators were a good tool in identifying any errors with syntax or otherwise, and I was able to fix all the issues that the validator identified to end with a good result. I am hoping that there aren't anymore unknown bugs I haven't found/fixed!

## Known Bugs

-   There is an issue with the underline hover style on the navigation, this is because of an issue with the size/padding/margin that I haven't been able to identify or rectify. The underline appears too large on both home and media links, on the community link it fits because I set the size to 88% of the content. 

![navigation-bug](./assets/images/readme/nav-bug.png)

-   A white border displays when I try to view the site on landscape mode on a mobile device. I'm still not sure how to fix it, googling and reading but I can't really find anything that solves it.
