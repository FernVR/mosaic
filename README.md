# Mosaic Media

I created this site to act as a community and blog for reviewing and recommending art and media that celebrates inclusivity and diversity through LGBT+ and BIPOC writers and creators. I had the idea for this project when I first decided to pursue coding. I wanted to use this idea for this project as it is a concept close to my heart, and I feel it reflects the kind of work I want to do within this industry in the future. I want to do everything I can to create positive and inclusive change to the world around me through the everyday technologies that we use.

You can find the live site [here](https://fernvr.github.io/mosaic/)

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        As a first time visitor, I want to:

        1. Easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the community.
        2. Easily navigate throughout the site to find content I'm looking for.
        3. Look at the community page to see whats happening and who gets involved.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        As a returning visitor, I want to:

        1. Find more media and art to connect to.
        2. Find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
        3. Engage in the community page to find events I can attend or subscribe to the newsletter. 

    -   #### Frequent User Goals

        As a frequent user, I want to:

        1. Check if theres new content on the media page.
        2. See if there's any new events, demonstrations or blog posts added to the community page.
        3. Sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme

        -   I wanted the colours to display a warm and neutral theme, with some brighter colours to add flare and art to the site.

    -   #### Typography

        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font and is both attractive and appropriate.

        -   I varied between font weights and letter spacing for titles and written content, to make everything clear and easy to read.

    -   #### Imagery

        -   I worked hard to make sure the imagery was consistent with the layout and theme for the site. I wanted the colours and images to have an artistic and minimal
            design theme as to not distract from the content.

*   ### Wireframes

    I didnt use any wireframe programmes. I started the project with a clear idea of what I wanted it to look like, then as I moved through the project I realised there were sections that were a bit too complex and took too much time to build. I then compressed the site a great deal to save on time, overall I think next time I will be using wireframes as it was quite time consuming to change each section. 
    
    I did some sketches throughout the project of different parts which I've left here for your reference:

-   The website was viewed and tested on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 10, iPhone 12, iPhone 14 Pro and iPad Pro.

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly, as well as buttons and form submition and inputs. (screenshot of all tests on   form)

-   I also did a good amount of testing the responsiveness of the website on different phone screens vertical and horizontal view, to make sure all the images and text are the correct size and position.

-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   There is an issue with the underline hover style on the navigation, this is because of an issue with the size that I haven't been able to rectify.
