                        <h3>Yellowface - R.F. Kuang</h3>
                        <p class="review-description">Rebecca F. Kuang is a Marshall Scholar, translator, and
                            award-winning, #1 New York Times
                            bestselling author of the Poppy War trilogy and Babel: An Arcane History, among others. She
                            has
                            an MPhil in Chinese Studies from Cambridge and an MSc in Contemporary Chinese Studies from
                            Oxford; she is now pursuing a PhD in East Asian Languages and Literatures at Yale.

                            In “Yellowface,” R.F. Kuang satirizes the publishing industry with a tale of a struggling
                            writer
                            who passes off her recently deceased friend's book as her own. When Athena dies in a freak
                            accident, June steals her unpublished manuscript and publishes it as her own under the
                            ambiguous
                            name Juniper Song. But as evidence threatens June's stolen success, she will discover
                            exactly
                            how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.

                            Yellowface by R. F. Kuang is a New York Times bestselling novel originally published on May
                            16,
                            2023. It is R. F. Kuangs fifth published novel and a stark departure from earlier work. Her
                            first four novels, The Poppy War trilogy and Babel, or the Necessity of Violence, are
                            fantasy
                            books, while Yellowface is a contemporary novel that Kuang considers, “a horror story about
                            loneliness in a fiercely competitive industry" The novels title references the film
                            industrys
                            practice of using white actors to
                            portray Asian characters, a fitting description of the protagonists actions throughout the
                            book.</p>

                        <p class="review-description">What a Time to Be Alone is a self-help book by Chidera Eggerue
                            that emphasizes the importance
                            of
                            embracing solitude and self-love. It provides practical advice and empowering insights for
                            finding happiness and fulfillment within ourselves.

                            Throughout What a Time to Be Alone, Eggerue punctuates her message with vibrant snippets of
                            her
                            Nigerian heritage. She shares translations of Igbo proverbs, weaving a canvas of cultural
                            wisdom
                            that amplifies and grounds her messages. These proverbs, passed down from generations, serve
                            as
                            her guiding light, teaching us to value our cultural heritage and use it as a lens by which
                            to
                            understand our world and place within it.

                            As the book reaches a close, we are shown an inspiring image of personal growth and
                            liberation.
                            According to Eggerue, the power of spending time with ourselves lies in the unique
                            perspective
                            it gives us. It centers our needs, desires, ambitions, and focuses us on finding our
                            personal
                            truths, uninfluenced by the noise of other's opinions or societal impositions</p>

                        <h3>The Good Immigrant</h3>
                        <p class="review-description">The Good Immigrant is an anthology of twenty-one essays edited by
                            Nikesh Shukla and first
                            published by Unbound in the UK in 2016 after a crowd-funding campaign endorsed by
                            celebrities.
                            Written by British authors who identify as BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic), the
                            essays
                            concern race, immigration, identity, 'otherness', exploring the experience of immigrant and
                            ethnic minority life in the United Kingdom from their perspective. Contributors include
                            actor/musician Riz Ahmed, journalist Reni Eddo-Lodge, comedian Nish Kumar and playwright
                            Vinay
                            Patel. The compilation inspired the American sequel The Good Immigrant USA, published in
                            2017,
                            which featured BAME authors from the United States.

                            described by Sandeep Parmar in The Guardian as "an unflinching dialogue about race and
                            racism in
                            the UK", which aims to "document… what it means to be a person of colour now", in light of
                            what
                            Shukla notes in the book's foreword "the backwards attitude to immigration and refugees and
                            the
                            systematic racism that runs through [Britain]". Written by twenty-one British authors of
                            Black,
                            Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, The Good Immigrant explores the personal and
                            universal experiences of immigrant and ethnic minority life in the United Kingdom. Shukla's
                            book
                            tells stories of "anger, displacement, defensiveness, curiosity, absurdity" as well as
                            "death,
                            class, microaggression, popular culture, access, freedom of movement, stake in society,
                            lingual
                            fracas, masculinity, and more".</p>

                        <p class="review-description">Lamya Hs powerful memoir Hijab Butch Blues is an honest grappling
                            with what it means to be
                            queer, to be a devout hijabi Muslim person who resists gender normativity, to love faith and
                            community. Seeking other queer women in Islam as a young person, H wonders if Maryam, whom
                            no
                            man has touched, is like her. She asks if Allah is a man or a woman and, dissatisfied with
                            counsel from religious teachers, decides for herself: Allah is They. She confronts her fear
                            of
                            jinn, who in lore and anecdote are shapeshifters never to be trusted, yet who are too often
                            conflated with brown men from her own community. Reading the story of Yusuf and the kings
                            stolen golden measuring cup forces H to confront her own withholding, how she unfairly tests
                            others because she is afraid to lose them. Using the second person point-of-view, she asks
                            Muhammad questions about belonging and betrayal.</p>

                        <p class="review-description">British trans artist, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Geo
                            Jordan has released a new EP
                            titled
                            Fathom, featuring the song “I Try to Forget”.

                            This track, part of the 5-song Fathom EP, was entirely written, performed, produced, and
                            mixed
                            by Geo and will be available on April 19, 2023. With the singers gentle voice accompanied by
                            beautiful instrumentation that harmonizes perfectly with the vocal performance, the song is
                            a
                            delight to listen to.

                            The album is a melancholic, futurist piece that delves into themes of losing a loved one and
                            strained relationships. The songs central portion features rich backing vocal pads, a
                            straightforward lead vocal, a dark reversed piano loop, a smooth driving bass line, and
                            simple
                            but snappy hip-hop drums.
                            With a history of prior writing and production credits with artists like BRIT Award-winning
                            Lianne La Havas, MOBO Award-winning Ego Ella May, Oscar Jerome, Sasha Keable, Laura Roy, and
                            more, Geo has also extensively toured internationally as a musician and musical director
                            with
                            critically acclaimed acts such as Jungle, JGrrey, Jack Garratt, and Rina Sawayama.

                        <p class="review-description">Singer-songwriter, and bisexual icon, Victoria Monét has won best
                            new artist at the 2024
                            Grammy Awards, beating out fellow nominees Gracie Abrams, Fred Again, Noah Kahan, Ice Spice,
                            Jelly Roll, Coco Jones, and the War and Treaty for the honour.

                            R&B doesnt get the love it once did, save for a select few musicians. Even so, that doesnt
                            stop some truly talented musicians from releasing music that knocks it out of the park.
                            Victoria Monét clearly has a great deal of love and respect for R&B. It shows consistently
                            from start to finish on her 2023 debut album, JAGUAR II. While JAGUAR II is her debut
                            album, it follows the singer/songwriters 2020 EP, JAGUAR. All an all, Monét brings the
                            heat on this project. There are no glaring miscues to be found.

                            Victoria Monét brings the heat on her debut studio album, JAGUAR II. Clearly, shes an
                            artist who respects the sanctity of R&B, with much of the production paying ode to the past.
                            Still, she manages to sound refreshing too, bringing attitude and edge to the table too.
                            Running a tight 11 tracks at just about 36 minutes, JAGUAR II is a win for Monét as well as
                            R&B as a whole. Dont sleep on Victoria.</p>

                            an artist in the most literal context. As a triple threat visionary who would rather create
                            his own lane than bore you with how its been done, there arent many up-and-coming artists
                            with this level of hunger, and it shows.

                            Rodney Chromes self-assuredness is palpable, built brick by brick as a black and queer
                            artist too loud for his conservative town in Arkansas. His NYU commencement speech brought
                            the entire world (and most notably, Taylor Swift) to tears not just because it explored the
                            grit of his story, but because it was raw and honest— like everything else he births into
                            the world.

                            Chrome plays characters, decorates himself in pristine performance, but never strays from
                            being the embodiment of his truth. Chromes commitment to exploring the boundaries of Pop,
                            R&B and Hip-Hop with his own electronic maximalist approach to musicality, and his
                            identifiably playful yet powerful lyrical and vocal styles are irreplicable, making him so
                            much larger than any one genre.</p>

                        <h3>JPEGMAFIA</h3>
                        <p class="review-description">JPEGMAFIA (real name Barrington DeVaughn Hendryx) has been a
                            big-name character in alt
                            hip-hop circles for a while, primarily because he really makes himself an iconoclast through
                            his music. There is little in terms of threads back to classic forms of rap in his music,
                            very few in the way of boom-bap or trap beats, and songs seem to deliberately be made like
                            chocolate teapots, dissolving from a semblance of structure into a fascinating mess.

                            Even top songs of his like "1539 N. Calvert" lack typical verses or choruses, twisting from
                            clicking glitch-hop into a dusty lo-fi mumble all in the space of under 3 minutes.
                            Comparison points can be made with artists like Earl Sweatshirt, Danny Brown or even
                            $uicideBoy$, but these intersections are like the marginal boundaries of a Venn diagram, as
                            JPEGs pursual of multi-phased and brain-melting instrumentals is like no other rapper or
                            producer out there.

                            JEGMAFIAs material is often abrasive and confrontational. Given his experiences of racism
                            in Alabama growing up, being a veteran of the Iraq war, this fury never feels undeserved.
                            However, in the last few years he has really began to excel by going more melodic and
                            flirting with character and gender, most obviously evident on 2019s All My Heroes are
                            Cornballs. This release saw a slight withdrawal from harsh, noise-like bursts to allow more
                            gorgeous hooks, however despite highlights like 'Free the Frail', 'Jesus Forgive Me I'm A
                            Thot', and 'Beta Male Strategies' offering great results, the rest of the record was quite a
                            blur, which made me less keen on keeping up with Hendryx's work.

                            Fred Hampton, a young, charismatic activist, becomes Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the
                            Black Panther Party - putting him directly in the crosshairs of the government, the FBI, and

                            George C. Wolfe, from a
                            screenplay by Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black, and a story by Breece about the life of
                            civil rights activist Bayard Rustin.[2] Produced by Barack and Michelle Obama's production
                            company Higher Ground, the film stars Colman Domingo in the title role, alongside Chris

                            who helped Martin Luther King Jr. and others organize the 1963 March on Washington.
                            The film tells the story of the charismatic, gay civil rights activist Bayard Rustin.
                            Despite incredible odds, he managed to organize the March on Washington in 1963. This event
                            is considered one of the high points of the civil rights movement in the United States. Over
                            200,000 people gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. and called for
                            an end to racial discrimination in the USA. Martin Luther King gave his famous "I Have a

                            written and directed by David Freyne. The film features two closeted teenagers in 1990s
                            Ireland who decide to start a fake relationship. The film was produced with assistance from

                            who loves cheerleading and
                            is dating Jared, a football player. However, she does not enjoy kissing Jared, instead
                            preferring to look at her fellow cheerleaders. This, combined with her interests in
                            vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, leads her parents, Peter and Nancy, and friends to
                            suspect that she is a lesbian. Aided by ex-gay Mike, they surprise her with an intervention.
                            She is then sent to True Directions, a two-month-long conversion therapy camp intended to
                            convert attendees to heterosexuality via a five-step program in which they admit their
                            homosexuality, rediscover their gender identity by performing stereotypically
                            gender-associated tasks, find the root of their homosexuality, demystify the opposite sex,
                            and simulate heterosexual intercourse. Upon arrival, she meets strict disciplinarian Mary J.
                            Brown, the program's director. Mary's son Rock is seen throughout the film making multiple
                            sexual overtures towards Mike and the other male campers.</p>

                            university where racial tensions
                            bubble just below the surface, Dear White People is a hilarious send-up of "post-racial"
                            America that weaves together the universal story of finding one's own identity and forging a
                            wholly unique path. The satirical series -- which picks up where the acclaimed 2014 film by
                            the same name left off - follows a group of Winchester University's students of color as

                            on the autism spectrum as he searches for love and independence. While Sam is on his funny

                            changes that come with growing up. Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as his mother, Elsa, who

                            of a companion piece, 20
                            Russell T Davies's new drama, It's a Sin (Channel 4), is something of a companion piece, 20
                            years on, to his groundbreaking masterpiece Queer as Folk. The latter was the riotous
                            celebration of gay urban life as led by three friends broadly representing different stages
                            of exploration as they embraced life as hot single men. In essence it was a gorgeous
                            fantasy, designed to counteract both the historic worthiness and prejudice surrounding such
                            depictions.

                            What it did not do was look much at the darkness out of which such freedom had emerged and
                            which still shadowed the lives of its Canal Street party people. It didn't, in short, deal
                            with the effects of Aids on the gay community.

                            It's a Sin does. Without losing any of Davies's gusto, irreverence, joy or subtlety, it
                            follows the lives of three young gay men, Ritchie (Olly Alexander), Roscoe (Omari Douglas)
                            and Colin (Callum Scott Howells) who move to London. They evolve into - in Armistead
                            Maupin's lovely phrase - each other's logical family (along with Ritchie's university best
                            friend Jill, played by Lydia West) as they commit themselves to the enjoyment of every
                            freedom the city has to offer.</p>
