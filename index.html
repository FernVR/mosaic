                <h2>A few words from our Founder</h2>
                <p>I am a South African/ Irish artist and creator living in Kilkenny, Ireland. I grew up in a rural
                    area, where it seemed as if there was no room for diversity.
                    Especially in creative scenes. The
                    people I
                    looked to
                    for creative guidance were people who didn't look like me or share any of my experiences. This is a
                    lonely, isolating experience for young people like me, and I've always wanted to try to spark
                    change. As I've grown up,
                    lived and worked in many
                    different parts of the world, I've connected to my heritage and the importance of
                    creating
                    inclusivity in spaces around me. I created this site with the goal of connecting people through art,
                    media and challenging the structures we grew up with.
                    Mosaic is a safe space, where all people can discover and share new art, as well appreciate and
                    connect to a
                    diverse point of view. All are welcome to our friendly space and we hope that you enjoy browsing and
                    hopefully connecting to our wonderful coterie.
